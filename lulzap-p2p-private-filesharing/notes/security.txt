"You are a magician and you must share your secret PDF with >2 Swiss acolytes"
  task: if KGB accesses your PDF you die; if you do something illegal you go to federal prison
    constraints:
      -completely peer-to-peer
      -completely clientside decentralized, including db

    aesthetic:
      -many will keep their groups running / seeding, not necessarily a hit and run thing
    bonus:
      -works when internet goes down

first: if someone gets the hash, your group is compromised
second: if someone cracks the hash, your group is compromised, therefore stop brute force by registering each hash attempt (2 max)
  -db only available when clients are online

third so plain surveillance of hash input is a problem but that's not really my concern.
not sure a way around this but maybe there is one

fourth the TURN server or STUN may be compromised, so that a third party gets between the interaction

fifth a peer's computer may be compromised
